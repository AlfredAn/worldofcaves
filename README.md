# World of Caves

An unfinished Minecraft clone from 2014. This was my first project using OpenGL and I learned a lot about 3D graphics, shaders, lighting, and shadow mapping from it. It features an infinite (in all 3 dimensions) procedurally generated world, and allows you to place and break blocks. It saves your position and the world seed upon exiting, but any changes you make to the world are not saved. Multithreading is also used to render block updates without slowing down the main thread.

When uploading this to GitHub in 2018, I wasn't able to get it to compile. There is however a working jar in the dist folder.
